## Description
Kujero is an App for buying couches in different colours. 
The users can add items to their cart, remove and add more that are the same types.
Each item has a price, and on the Side Bar (which is opened by clicking on the cart button) they can watch what they have in cart:
the different items and the total price of all of it. 

This is not my best App. It might even be the less impressive one. 
***But!*** I chosed to do it because I'm planning on creating much bigger app using TS with React.
In addition I included two new hooks that I've never used before, which you can read more about in the Technologies section.


## Technologies

- React.js (v18) & react-router (v6)
- Type Script
- Sass (mixins, variables, functions)

As I've done for the last few months, I created this App with hooks as well.
This time, I decided to use useContext and useLocalStorage, which I've never done before.


## Installation
Clone the project or dowload the files on top.
```
git clone https://github.com/OriBenAmram/Shoping-Cart.git
```
Open the terminal and enter the following line to run it locally on your computer:
```
npm i 
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

As I wrote, it's the first time that I used Type Script with React. 
I did it with this tutorial, after I've learned 7 hours course and practice on Udamy.
You are more than welcomed to contact me for any quastions about it.
I guess that everyone can write TS, but not every one can use the best conventions, and that is my goal. 

I'm currently working on my next project with [Rona Fainshtein](https://github.com/RonaFain/RonaFain "Rona's profile link"), who is also an instructor at Coding Academy with me. We are writting it with TS as well, and this time - it would be a huge and impressive App!
